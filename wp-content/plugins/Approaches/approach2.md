# HTML-to-PDF Conversion with Flexible Templating

## Overview
This method offers greater flexibility in certificate design by leveraging the power of HTML and CSS for layout, which is then converted into a PDF on the server.

## Implementation Details

### Admin Interface (Backend)
- Create a settings page under LearnDash menu:
  - Certificate Background Settings:
    - Upload/select background image for certificate template
    - Image guidelines and recommended dimensions
    - Preview of selected background
  - Signature Settings:
    - Upload/select signature image
    - Option to adjust signature size and position
    - Preview of signature placement
  - Element Position Management:
    - Visual drag-and-drop interface for positioning elements
    - Real-time preview with background image
    - Fine-tuning controls with numerical inputs
    - Coordinate storage per background image
    - Elements to position:
      - User name
      - Completion date
      - Course list
      - Signature
- Store settings using WordPress Options API for:
  - Background image ID
  - Signature image ID
  - Element coordinates for each background

### User Interface (Frontend)
- Implement a shortcode `[learndash_custom_certificate]` that displays:
  - List of user's completed LearnDash courses with checkboxes
  - Each course displayed with:
    - Course title
    - Checkbox for selection
  - "Generate Certificate" button to create certificates for selected courses
- Keep interface simple and user-friendly
- Support for multiple course selection

### Certificate Generation Logic (PHP)
1. **Data Collection**:
   - Process form submission
   - Retrieve selected course data from LearnDash
   - Get stored background and signature images
   - Fetch stored element coordinates for current background

2. **Template Processing**:
   - Apply background image from admin settings
   - Position elements using stored coordinates:
     - Place user name at specified position
     - Position completion date
     - Layout course list according to coordinates
     - Add signature at configured location
   - Generate complete PDF document

3. **PDF Generation**:
   - Use PDF library (TCPDF or similar)
   - Apply background image as base layer
   - Position text elements using stored coordinates
   - Stream generated PDF to user's browser

### Content Storage
- Store media assets and configuration:
  - Background images in media library
  - Signature images in media library
  - Element coordinates in wp_options
  - One coordinate set per background image
- Enables comprehensive control over:
  - Certificate background
  - Element positioning
  - Signature placement
  - Visual presentation
  - Layout consistency
