This rule applies to: `*.php` files in WordPress projects.

## File Organization

- Keep related functionality grouped together
- Place template files in appropriate theme directories
- Organize plugin files with clear separation of concerns

## Namespacing
- Use namespaces for all plugin code
- Follow PSR-4 autoloading standards when possible
- Structure namespaces to reflect the plugin's organization

## Class Structure
- One class per file
- Name files according to the class they contain
- Follow WordPress naming conventions (CamelCase for classes)
- Keep classes focused on a single responsibility

## Functions
- Group related functions together
- Use prefixes for functions in the global namespace
- Consider organizing functions into appropriate classes when possible

## Hooks
- Document all hooks with clear descriptions
- Group related hooks together
- Use consistent naming conventions for hooks
- Prefix custom hooks with the plugin or theme name
