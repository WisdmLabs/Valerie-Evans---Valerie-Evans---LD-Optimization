# WordPress Accessibility

This rule applies to: `*.php` files in WordPress theme and plugin projects.

## Semantic HTML
- Use appropriate semantic HTML elements (`<nav>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, etc.)
- Ensure correct heading hierarchy (h1-h6)
- Use lists (`<ul>`, `<ol>`) for navigation and grouped items
- Structure forms with proper labeling

## ARIA Attributes
- Use ARIA attributes only when necessary
- Ensure ARIA attributes have valid values
- Test ARIA implementations with screen readers
- Prefer native HTML elements with built-in accessibility features

## Keyboard Navigation
- Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard accessible
- Maintain logical tab order
- Provide visible focus styles
- Implement skip-to-content links

## Media
- Include alt text for all images
- Provide transcripts for audio content
- Include captions and descriptions for video content
- Ensure sufficient color contrast

## Forms
- Associate labels with form fields using `for` attribute
- Group related form elements with `<fieldset>` and `<legend>`
- Provide clear error messages
- Mark required fields appropriately

## Testing
- Test with keyboard-only navigation
- Validate HTML for accessibility issues
- Test with screen readers
- Check color contrast ratios
