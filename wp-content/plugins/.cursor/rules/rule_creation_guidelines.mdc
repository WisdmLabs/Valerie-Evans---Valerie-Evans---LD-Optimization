# MDC Rule Creation Guidelines

## Location
- All MDC rules must be created in the `.cursor/rules` folder
- Each rule must be in its own separate file

## Naming Convention
- Use descriptive filenames that clearly indicate the rule's purpose
- Use snake_case for filenames (e.g., `code_formatting.mdc`, `documentation_standards.mdc`)
- Always use the `.mdc` extension for rule files

## File Pattern Specification
- Begin each rule with a statement specifying which files the rule applies to
- Use glob patterns to define file scope (e.g., `*.php`, `src/**/*.js`)
- Format as: `This rule applies to: \`pattern\` files in [project type]`
- Be specific about project type or directory scope when relevant

## MDC Format
- Include front matter metadata at the top of the file between triple dashes (`---`)
- Required metadata fields:
  - `description`: Brief description of the rule's purpose
  - `globs`: Array of file patterns this rule applies to (or empty array for manual/always applied rules)
  - `alwaysApply`: Boolean indicating if the rule should always be applied

## Content Structure
- Start with a clear title using H1 (`# Title`)
- Include a brief description of the rule's purpose
- Organize rule details using appropriate headings (H2, H3)
- Use bullet points for lists of requirements or guidelines
- Include examples when helpful

## Implementation
When creating a new rule via Cursor AI:
- Always place it in the `.cursor/rules` directory
- Create it as a standalone file with `.mdc` extension
- Include appropriate file pattern specification
- Follow standard Markdown formatting
- Group related rules by using consistent name prefixes
